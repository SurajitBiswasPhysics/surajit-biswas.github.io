              <p class="p-heading"> Beyond the Lab: A Symphony of Passions: Guitar, Digital Art, and Gym</p>
              <p>Strings strummed and chords resonating, the guitar is my emotional outlet. Whether I'm navigating the blues or exploring intricate fingerstyle patterns, it's not just music; it's a conversation with my soul. In the world of pixels and brushes, I find creative freedom. Digital art lets me transcend boundaries, from graphic design to abstract compositions. Each stroke is a visual narrative, an exploration of boundless imagination. Clanging, heart pounding—the gym is my sanctuary for physical and mental transformation. It's not just about reps; it's a journey of discipline, pushing limits, and finding synergy between mind and body.</p>
              <p> While seemingly diverse, these passions share a common theme—pursuing excellence through creativity and discipline. The rhythm of the guitar mirrors artistic flow, and the discipline of the gym resonates with the commitment needed for mastery. In the fusion of guitar strums, digital strokes, and gym sessions, I discover not just hobbies, but avenues for personal growth. Each passion contributes a unique note to the symphony of my life, creating a harmonious blend that defines who I am—a creator, an enthusiast, and a seeker of excellence.</p>

              <p class="p-heading"> Gravitational Theory, Black Holes, and Their Interconnection</p>

         <p>Gravitational theory stands as a cornerstone in the realm of physics, elegantly described by both Newtonian gravity and Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Newton's formulation, with its classical principles, delineates gravitational attraction as a force directly proportional to the product of two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Einstein's revolutionary theory, on the other hand, interprets gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.</p>

        <p>At the pinnacle of gravitational phenomena lie black holes—celestial entities of immense density, formed through the gravitational collapse of massive stars. Governed by the predictions of General Relativity, a black hole's defining feature is the event horizon, a boundary beyond which no light or matter can escape. This gravitational singularity, an infinitesimally small and dense point at the center of a black hole, challenges our conventional understanding of the physical universe.</p>

        <p>The intricate connection between gravitational theory and black holes is profound. Gravitational forces, as elucidated by Einstein, dictate the formation and dynamics of black holes. These cosmic entities, in turn, serve as crucibles for testing and refining our understanding of gravity under extreme conditions. The study of black holes has unveiled new dimensions in our comprehension of spacetime, gravitational waves, and the fundamental nature of the cosmos.</p>

        <p>In essence, gravitational theory and black holes are intricately intertwined, each enriching the other in a cosmic dance that unravels the mysteries of the universe. The gravitational pull that shapes planets and galaxies also orchestrates the enigmatic ballet of black holes, contributing to the grand narrative of our cosmic journey.</p>

              <p class="p-heading"> My Ph.D. Works</p>

              <p>My research area involves the study of gravitational theories in 2+1 dimensions, which have asymptotically flat boundaries, and the study of black hole physics, more precisely, the study of the quantum corrections of the black hole entropy in 3+1 dimensional gravitational system. These gravitational theories may involve supersymmetries. </p>
              <p>Gravitational theories in the 2+1 dimensions are special as they do not pose any local degree of freedom. Non-trivial excitations, known as boundary gravitons, only exist at the boundary of the spacetime. These facts motivate us to look for a dual theory at the boundary of the 2+1 dimensional spacetime that might describe the dynamics of the boundary gravitons. The duals can be found by using the equivalence of 2+1 dimensional gravity and Chern Simons(CS) theory. It is well known that 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories with a boundary can be reduced to a 1+1 dimensional  Wess-Zumino-Witten(WZW) theory that can be gauge fixed to a Liouville-like theory. These Liouville-like theories play the role of a dual for 2+1 dimensional gravity.</p>
              <p>During the course of my Ph.D., I have successfully concluded two projects, and currently, I am actively engaged in an ongoing research endeavor. The details of these undertakings are elucidated below.</p>
              <p>(i) We have studied maximally \(\mathcal{N}\) extended 2+1 dimensional flat Supergravity theories exist for a class of super-Poincare algebras for arbitrary \(\mathcal{N}\). They have rich asymptotic structures and contain all interesting topological supergravity solutions in presence of non-trivial holonomy. For the asymptotic symmetry algebra being a suitable flat limit of the superconformal algebra, which is an infinite dimensional extension of two copies of \(Osp(\mathcal{N}|2;R)\) group, we have found the $1+1$ dimensional chiral WZW model as the dual quantum field theory that describes the dynamics of these solutions. In the Hamiltonian analysis, the reduced phase space resembles a flat super Liouville theory.</p>
              <p>(ii) We have studied BMS algebra in three spacetime dimensions can be deformed into a two parameter family of algebra known as \(W(a,b)\) algebra. For \(a=0\), we show that other than \(W(0,-1)\), no other \(W(0,b)\) algebra admits a non-degenerate bilinear and thus one can not have a Chern-Simons gauge theory formulation with them. However, they may appear in a three-dimensional gravity description, where we also need to have a spin 2 generator, that comes from the \( (a=0,b=-1) \) sector. In the present work, we have demonstrated that the asymptotic symmetry algebra of a spin 3 gravity theory on flat spacetime has both the \(W(0,-1)\) and \(W(0,-2)\) algebras as subalgebras. We have also constructed a dual boundary field theory for this higher spin gravity theory by using the Chern-Simons/Wess-Zumino-Witten correspondence.</p>
              <p>(iii) In the ongoing work, we are investigating the leading quantum-gravitational correction to the black hole entropy, which is known to be a universal logarithmic term. We investigate the logarithmic corrections for the black holes in the STU supergravity models as a consistent bosonic truncation into a specific class of \(U(1)^{2}\) -charged Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. The logarithmic correction results are calculated by employing two distinct Euclidean quantum gravity setups for the extremal and non-extremal limits of the embedded rotating, static, charged and neutral black holes, followed by the heat kernel method-based on-shell Seeley-DeWitt expansion computations.  </p>
